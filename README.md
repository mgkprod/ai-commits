# AI Commits

A Raycast extension that writes your git commit messages for you with Raycast AI.

## Usage

Focus either a Finder window or an iTerm window and run the command from Raycast. The extension will then generate a commit message for you and ask if you want to copy it to your clipboard.

## Credits

This extension takes inspiration from [AI Commits](https://github.com/Nutlope/aicommits/), a CLI tool that generates commit messages using OpenAI.
